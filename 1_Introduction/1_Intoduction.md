# Welcome to Learning APIs

Hello and welcome to a course on learning APIs. In this course, we're going to learn all about APIs and RESTful APIs and how they work behind the scenes. You're going to learn a lot in here, but one of the things you're not going to learn is how to build an API.

If you're looking at how to create an API from scratch or how to implement one, this is not that course. We are simply going to learn the concepts of an API and how they work and why they're important.

If that sounds like something you're completely interested in, please feel free to watch the rest of this course. I look forward to working with you.
