# Understanding APIs

Hello and welcome to Understanding APIs. This is a course where we're going to learn all about APIs. So the first thing we need to know is: what is an API?

Well, an API is an application programming interface. It's not actually a visual interface like what you see in front of you. No, it's nothing like that. It is a programming interface. So it is, I mean, it's sort of visual. If you were a computer, it would seem visual, but we're not, so we can't see it. And it just looks like a wall of code. But essentially, all it is is one computer talking to another. That's it. It's very, very simple.

And it doesn't matter what programming language you're using. You can use JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, Ruby, any variation of Câ€”basically any language that supports Internet communication will support APIs and RESTful APIs. And there is a difference. We'll talk about those in just a little bit.
